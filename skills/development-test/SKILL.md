# Test

Analyze and improve test coverage for "$ARGUMENTS". Write tests for untested code paths, edge cases, and critical functionality.

**Arguments.** `$ARGUMENTS` may contain the project name and optional flags. Take the first token as `<project>` and treat `--skip-checks` as a flag; never include flags in file paths. All paths below use `<project>`. If `--skip-checks` is present, skip the prerequisite check and, **before writing any artifact**, append one line to `.singularskills/log.jsonl`: `{"ts":"<ISO timestamp>","skill":"development-test","workflow":"development","phase":3,"project":"<project>","event":"skipped","artifact":"03-test.md","note":"<reason or \"none given\">"}`.

## Prerequisites

**Part of a workflow.** This skill is phase 3 (Test) of the Plan-Build-Test-Ship workflow (`development`); cross-domain workflows run it too. First check `.singularskills/log.jsonl` for an open run for this project: a `run-started` line with `"project":"<project>"` and no later `run-finished` line for the same `workflow` and `project`. If one exists, the conductor is running you: continue here. Otherwise, if the user asked to start, run, continue or resume a process or workflow rather than this one step, do not continue here: invoke the `workflow` skill with the workflow the user asked for, or `development` when they named none, followed by `<project>`; it runs this phase in order, asks before it writes and records the run. Otherwise continue here: a later phase runs on its own, behind its gate.

Before you start work, append this line to `.singularskills/log.jsonl` (create the folder and file if missing): `{"ts":"<ISO timestamp>","skill":"development-test","workflow":"development","phase":3,"project":"<project>","event":"started","artifact":"03-test.md","note":""}`.

None — this is a utility skill that can run anytime.

## Process

1. **Analyze existing code:**
   - Read the source code related to "<project>"
   - Identify all public functions, methods, and components
   - Map code paths: happy paths, error paths, edge cases

2. **Assess current test coverage:**
   - Read existing tests for "<project>"
   - Identify what's tested and what's not
   - Note tests that are shallow (only happy path) or brittle (testing implementation, not behavior)

3. **Write missing tests:**
   - Prioritize: critical paths first, then edge cases, then error handling
   - Each test should verify behavior, not implementation
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what's being verified
   - Follow the project's existing test patterns and framework

4. **Run the full test suite:**
   - Verify all new tests pass
   - Verify no existing tests broke
   - Note any flaky or slow tests discovered

5. **Write the artifact** to `.singularskills/development/<project>/03-test.md` with sections:
   - **Coverage Assessment** — what was already tested, what wasn't
   - **Tests Added** — list of new tests with what they verify
   - **Remaining Gaps** — what still needs testing (if any)
   - **Test Health** — any flaky, slow, or problematic tests found

## Output

The test report written to `.singularskills/development/<project>/03-test.md`. Present a summary to the user highlighting:
- Number of tests added
- Key coverage gaps filled
- Any remaining concerns

**Record the run.** After you have written the artifact, append this line to `.singularskills/log.jsonl` (the `started` line of Prerequisites, with `"event":"finished"`): `{"ts":"<ISO timestamp>","skill":"development-test","workflow":"development","phase":3,"project":"<project>","event":"finished","artifact":"03-test.md","note":""}`.

Open the artifact with this frontmatter (`agent` is the agent you run in, or `unknown`; `gate` is `none`, as this phase has no gate):

```yaml
---
skill: development-test
workflow: development
phase: 3
project: <project>
started: <ISO timestamp>
finished: <ISO timestamp>
agent: <the agent you run in, or "unknown">
gate: none
---
```

End the artifact with `## Decisions` and `## Open questions`, in this shape:

```markdown
## Decisions
- <what was chosen> — <why> — <what was rejected>

## Open questions
- <what the next phase or a reviewer must settle>
```
