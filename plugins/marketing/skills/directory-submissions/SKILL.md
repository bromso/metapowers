# Directory Submissions

Plan a directory and listing site strategy for "$ARGUMENTS". Identify high-value directories, optimize listings, and build a submission plan.

**Arguments.** `$ARGUMENTS` may contain the project name and optional flags. Take the first token as `<project>` and treat `--skip-checks` as a flag; never include flags in file paths. All paths below use `<project>`. If `--skip-checks` is present, skip the prerequisite check and, **before writing any artifact**, append one line to `.metapowers/marketing/<project>/skip-log.md`: `- <ISO timestamp> — <skill name> skipped prerequisite check for <artifact file> — reason: <reason or "none given">`.

## Prerequisites

Read `.metapowers/marketing/<project>/00-strategy.md`. If this file does not exist, tell the user:

> Phase 0 (Strategy) has not been completed for "<project>". Run `/marketing:customer-research <project>` first, or use `--skip-checks` to bypass.

## Process

1. **Read context:**
   - Read `.metapowers/marketing/<project>/00-strategy.md` for product category and positioning

2. **Research directories:**
   - Use WebSearch to find relevant directories for the "<project>" category
   - Include: product directories (G2, Capterra, Product Hunt), industry-specific directories, startup directories, review sites
   - Evaluate each: domain authority, traffic, audience relevance, cost

3. **Prioritize submissions:**
   - Rank directories by: traffic potential, SEO value (backlinks), audience match, effort
   - Separate into tiers: must-have, nice-to-have, low-priority
   - Note submission requirements and timelines

4. **Optimize listings:**
   - Craft optimized descriptions per directory (length, keyword, tone vary)
   - Screenshot and asset requirements
   - Category and tag selection strategy
   - Review solicitation plan

5. **Write the artifact** — append to `.metapowers/marketing/<project>/01-reach.md` under a `## Directory Submissions` section. Create the file with a `# Reach — <project>` heading if it does not exist; if a `## Directory Submissions` section already exists, replace only that section. The section contains:
   - **Directory List** — prioritized with domain authority and audience fit
   - **Submission Plan** — timeline and requirements per directory
   - **Listing Copy** — optimized descriptions per tier
   - **Review Strategy** — how to build reviews on key platforms

## Output

Directory strategy appended to `.metapowers/marketing/<project>/01-reach.md`. Present a summary highlighting:
- Top 5 directories to submit to first
- Estimated timeline for submissions
- Review generation recommendations
