One pack of agent skills for digital production work: **283 skills across 16 domains**, from design and research to legal, security and accounting. Each skill is a plain `SKILL.md` folder that any agent supporting the Agent Skills format can load.

What you get:

- **Skills**: one folder per task (`design-empathize`, `development-plan`, ...). Each says what it needs first, what it does step by step, and where it writes its result.
- **Workflows**: one YAML file per workflow (`workflows/design.yml`, `workflows/launch-product.yml`, ...) that puts skills into ordered phases. The `workflow` skill runs one phase at a time and stops for your approval at every boundary.
- **Gates**: a skill whose phase needs earlier results checks that they exist before it writes (its `scripts/gate.sh`, plus a write hook in Claude Code). Pass `--skip-checks` to go ahead anyway; the skip is recorded.
- **Run log**: every started run, approved phase and skipped gate is one line in `.singularskills/log.jsonl`, so you, your team and the `singular-status` skill can see where each project stands.

> Migrating from metapowers: move `.metapowers/` to `.singularskills/` and replace `/domain:skill` with `/domain-skill`.

## Install

**Any agent** (the universal installer copies `skills/` into each detected agent's skills folder):

```bash
npx skills add bromso/singularskills            # this project
npx skills add bromso/singularskills --global   # every project, user scope
npx skills add bromso/singularskills --agent codex -y   # one agent, no prompts
```

Skills land in `.agents/skills/` for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI and Kimi Code CLI, and in `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code. Each skill keeps its `scripts/` (the phase gates, executable) and `references/` folders.

**Claude Code** (also installs the `/design-empathize`-style command wrappers and the gate hook):

```
/plugin marketplace add bromso/singularskills
/plugin install singularskills@singularskills
```

**Codex:**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add bromso/singularskills
codex plugin add singularskills@singularskills
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI:** use the universal installer. For Gemini command wrappers (`/design-empathize` and the rest), also copy `adapters/gemini/commands/*.toml` into `.gemini/commands/` (project) or `~/.gemini/commands/` (user).

Workflow artifacts are written to `.singularskills/<domain>/<project>/` in your project. That folder is meant to be committed: it is the record of what each phase produced, and the gates read it.

Then try a skill (the Claude Code and Gemini CLI command form; other agents pick skills up by name or description):

```
/design-empathize date-picker
/research-discover user-onboarding
/development-plan auth-system
```

### Supported agents

**Tier 1, tested per release** (`scripts/smoke-install.sh` installs into each and runs a gate): Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code and CLI), Gemini CLI, Kimi Code CLI.

**Tier 2, supported through the universal installer, not tested per release:** everything `npx skills add` supports, including Windsurf, Zed, Cline, Antigravity, Roo Code, Qwen Code, Goose, Amp, Kilo Code, Trae and the rest.

## How It Works

Each domain's skills follow the phases of a proven methodology. A workflow file lists the phases, the artifact each one writes, and what it requires:

```yaml
name: design
folder: design
phases:
  - phase: 1
    title: Empathize
    artifact: 01-empathize.md
    requires: []
    skills: [design-empathize]
  - phase: 2
    title: Define
    artifact: 02-define.md
    requires: [01-empathize.md]
    skills: [design-define-component]
```

- **Run one skill** by name: `/design-empathize date-picker` writes `.singularskills/design/date-picker/01-empathize.md`.
- **Run a whole workflow** with the conductor: `/workflow design date-picker` runs phase 1, plays back what it decided, and asks before it moves to phase 2.
- **Gates keep the order**: `/design-define-component date-picker` will not write `02-define.md` until `01-empathize.md` exists, unless you pass `--skip-checks`.
- **Artifacts** are Markdown files with a short frontmatter (skill, workflow, phase, finished) under `.singularskills/<folder>/<project>/`. Commit them.

## Cross-Domain Skills

```bash
/workflow launch-product acme          # Run a cross-domain workflow phase by phase
/singular-status                       # Where every project stands, from the run log
/singular-report                       # Cross-domain summary report
/singular-detect                       # Scan the project's stack, suggest skills
/singular-find-skill <topic>           # Search skill marketplaces
/singular-create-skill <topic>         # Write a new skill in this pack's format
/singular-improve-skill <name>         # Refine a skill from feedback
```
